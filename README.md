### Specifications:

- Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript

- The web application will be composed of 4 pages:
   - a "home page": a list showing all the items available for sale.
    
   - a "product page": dynamically displays the product selected by the user and allows him to customize the product and add it to his shopping cart
    
   - a "shopping cart":  a summary of the products in the cart, the total price and a form to place an order. The data form must be correct and well formated before being                    sent to the back-end.
   
   - a "confirmation page": thanking the user, and indicating the order, the total price and the order ID sent by the server.

- The source code should be indented and use comments. It should also use global functions.

- User inputs must be validated before being sent to the API.

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
